99	Kihansi Gorge Amphibian Species Checklist	This is a checklist of Amphibian Species in the Kihansi Gorge in the Udzungwa Tanzania. It is an important information on Biodiversity status of the Udzungwa Mountains as a Mega Biodiverse Hotspot of the Eastern Arc Mountains. It contains endemic and species with the risk of extinction (endangered, critically endangered, extinct in the wild). The studies on amphibian species commenced with the discovery of the Kihansi Spray Toad (KST) (Nectophrynoides asperginis) in December 1996 and its description in 1998 (Poynton et al., 1998). To date several species of amphibians in the Order Anura in Five different Families have been identified to exist in the Kihansi Gorge. Unfortunately Nectophrynoides asperginis went extinct in the wild mainly due to habitat alteration by the Kihansi River water abstraction where water is used for Hydro power project. Further studies are underway to establish the exact cause of the population crash of KST in the Kihansi Gorge as one of the effort to bring back the KST population in the  wild. These include the studies on Chytrid fungus, sediments flush from the reservoir,agricultural pesticide residue and water quality changes. Thanks to the Captive breeding programs that the species is under control for reintroduction back to its original habitat. This description therefore intends to report the amphibians occurring in the Kihansi Gorge i.e. amphibians occurring in the Spray Wetlands, at the edges of the spray wetlands as well as those appearing in other areas of the gorge. These are important for testing different scientific scenarios related to KSTs disappearance in the Kihansi Gorge since 2003.				14	0		0	2012-02-09 18:21:12	2012-02-09 18:21:12

106	COA Wildlife Conservation List	Taiwan's unique geographical location and varied topography resulted in diverse fauna on this beautiful island. However, excessive land development and resource utilization have incessantly squeezed the space for the survival of wildlife. Wildlife conservation is not just a simple act of protection, it warrants reasonable and sustainable use of natural resources.\\nThe Wildlife Conservation Act, enacted by Council of Agriculture, Executive Yuan, is an important legal basis for wildlife management and habitat protection. Its purpose is to maintain species diversity and ecological balance. The government and related conservation organizations have designated 17 wildlife refuges. Not only are they the subject of academic researches, they are also the indicators of environmental quality. The checklist of Taiwan (TaiBNET) lists 238 endangered, rare, and other protected species of wildlife in Taiwan. The database also provides information on these species, such as their scientific names (including authors and years), common names, and synonyms. Through Taiwan Biodiversity Information Facility (TaiBIF), the information can be shared and exchanged with other GBIF participants. Users can use keywords to link to other websites with relevant information. All these efforts will result in the circulation of information in the fields of research, education and conservation, which in turn will arouse global attention to the protection of wildlife.				14	0		0	2012-02-09 18:21:23	2012-02-09 18:21:23

The book summarises the result of rapid biological and social inventories carried out by team of scientists in the Southern GaoligongShan of Yunnan in China. The biological inventories do not attempt to produce an exhaustive list of species or higher taxa. Rather, the rapid surveys (1) identify the important biological communities in the site or region of interest and (2) determine whether these communities are of outstanding quality and significance in a regional\\nor global context. During rapid social asset inventories, scientists and local communities collaborate to identify patterns of social organization and opportunities for capacity building.				14	0		0	2012-02-09 18:21:31	2012-02-09 18:21:31

121	Taiwanese IUCN species list	The Red List of Threatened Species, published by International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), lists the conservation status of a representative selection of plant and animal species according to the level of threat to their survival. A species may have a limited distribution or be found only in a small area in a country. From the point of view of biodiversity, however, the extinction of any species can prompt a global impact. Therefore, the related information of an endangered species should be recognized and its conservation effort be executed.\\nIUCN estimates that there are 20,000 endangered species. The checklist of Taiwan (TaiBNET) lists 127 species as vulnerable (VU) or higher levels. The scientific name (including author and year), common names, synonyms, assessment level, and other information of these species are also included in the database. Taiwan, even the whole world, needs to actively promote the conservation work of these species. Through Taiwan Biodiversity Information Facility (TaiBIF), the information of Taiwan’s endangered species can be shared and exchanged with other GBIF participants. Users can use keywords to link to other websites with relevant information. All these efforts are to draw the world's attention to the conservation issue of endangered animals and plants.				14	0		0	2012-02-09 18:23:21	2012-02-09 18:23:21

With diverse terrain and wide range of vertical elevations, Taiwan has tropical, subtropical, temperate, and frigid climate zones. These unique geographical conditions, coupled with the effect of habitat isolation, gave Taiwan its high biodiversity.\\nThe endemic species of Taiwan denotes the native plants and animals of Taiwan and its offshore islands such as Penghu Archipelago, Orchid Island, Green Island, etc. Even though the areas are small, the Checklist of Taiwan (TaiBNET) lists around 50,000 valid species scientific names. Among them, 8,000 are endemic species (including endemic subspecies and varietas), showing the abundance of Taiwan’s endemic Species. TaiBNET also provides information on these species, such as their scientific names (including authors and years), common names, and synonyms. Through Taiwan Biodiversity Information Facility (TaiBIF), the information on these endemic species are published and then shared and exchanged with other GBIF participants. Users can use keywords to link to other websites with relevant information. All these efforts will result in the circulation and utilization of information in the areas of research, education and conservation.				14	0		0	2012-02-09 18:27:40	2012-02-09 18:27:40

142	/home/dimus/files/dwca/clemens.zip	The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 6th Edition was published and released by Cornell University Press in June 2007. The book was produced from a nearly completed manuscript left by James Clements upon his death in 2005.<br/>The Cornell Lab of Ornithology has accepted the job of maintaining the ever-changing list of species, subspecies, English names, and approximate distributions, beginning with publication of the 6th Edition. Our procedures for accomplishing this ongoing task include using the considerable expertise of our research ornithologists on staff, aided enormously by input from knowledgeable professional and amateur cooperators worldwide. We invite input on known or suspected errors or updates at any time.<br/>This web site serves as the clearinghouse for keeping your Clements Checklist up to date. We will post all corrections once a year in October. At the same time, we'll post updates to the taxonomy, scientific and English nomenclature, and range descriptions, to incorporate changes that have made their way into the literature and are generally accepted by the appropriate scientific body or community. In the future, we will also be posting a list of alternative English names.				14	0		0	2012-02-09 18:31:06	2012-02-09 18:31:06

153	The National Checklist of Taiwan	The catalog of Taiwanese species is call "TaiBNET" and the national node of GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) in Taiwan is called "TaiBIF". Currently, the websites have been established at Academia Sinica (http://taibnet.sinica.edu.tw and http://www.gbif.org.tw). Both of the Biodiversity Research Center and the Computing Center of Academia Sinica are in charge of the maintenance and the updating biodiversity related information and data.\\nThrough the node, the background of participating GBIF, related documents, news, upcoming conferences, name list of Taiwanese taxonomists, catalog of life in Taiwan, specimen database, biodiversity related organization, team research projects, independent biological databases, natural heritage, and local publications etc. can be accessed. Among them, "Name list of Taiwanese taxonomists" and "Catalog of Life of Taiwan" are one promoting project sponsored by the National Science Council. So far, 236 local taxonomists have included their titles, telephones, e-mail addresses, and the taxa that they are expertised. In the future, we hope to include all of the ecologists or the applied scientists in agriculture, forestry, fishery, and animal husbandry in the name list.\\nThe first phase of Catalog of Life in Taiwan will contain the following items of animals (including insects), plants, and fungi: species names, authors and year, suggested Chinese names, endemic in Taiwan or not, their classification hierarchy, the most authorized citation proving that particular species has occurred in Taiwan. Users can get the name list of one group of organisms through keywords search, species name searching, or image searching etc. Further information of each species can be obtained through the hyperlink to more than 18 well-known global databases or networks, such as Species2000 and ITIS etc. Right now, more than 30,000 species have been compiled, and we hope to collect more than 60,000 species by July 2004. Species checklist of the microorganisms will be included next year. We hope to get more funding and collaborators in the next phase to collect specimen or ecological photos (endemic species first), description (morphology, ecology and biology), geographical distribution, synonyms, literatures, as well as deposited specimen data for each species.\\nThrough this node, the most authorized information of high biodiversity and endemism of Taiwan can be exchanged and shared with other GBIF participants. This mission is also requested by both of the Convention on Biological Diversity and GBIF to each member because in such a way, education, research, and conservation of biodiversity in the world could be promoted effectively.				14	0		0	2012-02-09 18:44:03	2012-02-09 18:44:03

Animals, plants, fungi: you can make your way through a total of more than 32.000 species!\\nThe Belgian species list was set up by the RBINS – the research institution behind the Museum of Natural Sciences – in cooperation with different Belgian and international institutions and organizations.\\nThe purpose of the species list is to become the online reference in naming and occurrence of species in Belgium, easy to consult in just one website that centralizes and standardizes the information. For every species that's been described, information is given on among other things the conservation status, the distribution, the habitat and much more. More and more species index cards are fitted with pictures and interesting links.\\nThe website is aimed at a broad audience: researchers, decision makers, students, journalists, nature conversationists and all nature lovers.\\nWant to know more? \\nLog on to www.species.be!				14	0		0	2012-02-09 18:48:44	2012-02-09 18:48:45

163	IUCN Red List of Threatened Species	The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species™ is widely recognized as the most comprehensive, objective global approach for evaluating the conservation status of plant and animal species. From its small beginning, the IUCN Red List has grown in size and complexity and now plays an increasingly prominent role in guiding conservation activities of governments, NGOs and scientific institutions. The introduction in 1994 of a scientifically rigorous approach to determine risks of extinction that is applicable to all species, has become a world standard. In order to produce the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species™, the IUCN Species Programme working with the IUCN Survival Commission (SSC) and with members of IUCN draws on and mobilizes a network of scientists and partner organizations working in almost every country in the world, who collectively hold what is likely the most complete scientific knowledge base on the biology and conservation status of species.				14	0		0	2012-02-09 19:18:20	2012-02-09 19:18:22
